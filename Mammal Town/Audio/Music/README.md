# Music

No music is currently composed for Mammal Town.

When music is composed, there are some guidelines that are to be followed:

## Music guidelines

Music will be licensed under the Creative Commons Attributes 0 license or the GNU General Public License 3.0, whichever one is preferred.

> Music will automatically be Royalty-free and anyone can download, edit, remix, and reshare it without any form of monetization. This means that the music will automatically be in the Public Domain when published.

The original Nintendo Animal Crossing soundtracks cannot be used due to copyright reasons.

> Do not re-upload the music or sound effects from any of the Animal Crossing games. We need to be original. Also, Nintendo is big on their copyright and this wouldn't pass in decades

> Do not use Nintendo motifs/leitmotifs or anything that is similar enough to one to result in a C&D (Cease and Desist) letter. It has to be at least 51% different.
